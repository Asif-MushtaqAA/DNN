# DNN
An encoder-decoder CNN model capable of predicting flow field variables around an aerofoil.

The model predcits flow field variables (density, u velocity, v velocity, internal energy anf turbulence intensity) based on signed distance function (sdf) array of an aerofoil.

The model in implemented using PyTorch.

Example implementation can be found in the respective scripts in the UI folder. Run the console in the UI folder.
