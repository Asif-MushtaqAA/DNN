# DNN
An encoder-decoder CNN model capable of predicting flow field variables around an aerofoil.

The model predcits flow field variables (density, u velocity, v velocity, internal energy anf turbulence intensity) based on signed distance function (sdf) array of an aerofoil.

The model in implemented using PyTorch.
